# AWS SageMaker QA Model with Inference

This project demonstrates how to deploy and use a question-answering model on AWS SageMaker. The project involves setting up the environment, configuring the necessary parameters, and deploying a Hugging Face model for inference.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- AWS SDK for Python (`boto3`)
- SageMaker SDK for Python (`sagemaker`)
- AWS credentials configured with necessary permissions to use SageMaker service

## Installation

1. **Install the required libraries**:

    ```bash
    pip install sagemaker -U
    ```

2. **Configure AWS credentials**:

    Ensure your AWS credentials are configured. You can do this by setting up the `~/.aws/credentials` file or by using environment variables.

## Usage

1. **Script Overview**:

    This script sets up an environment to deploy a Hugging Face question-answering model on AWS SageMaker. It includes steps to configure the session, role, and model parameters.

2. **Running the Notebook**:

    To run the notebook, execute the cells in your Jupyter notebook environment. This will set up the necessary configurations, deploy the model, and make inference requests.

## Example Output

After running the notebook, you should see responses from the deployed model to the questions provided in the `data` payload.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that your AWS credentials are correctly configured.
- Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the SageMaker service.
- Check for any network connectivity issues that may prevent reaching the AWS services.
